    - `CallVideo/` - WebRTC video calling
  - `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
  - `lib/` - Utility libraries (cn utility for class merging)
  - `models/` - TypeScript interfaces/models
  - `routes/` - Routing configuration
  - `utils/` - Utility functions

## Tech Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite 7 as build tool
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- TanStack Query for server state
- Tailwind CSS v4 with modern design system
- shadcn/ui components (migrated from Ant Design)
- Radix UI primitives
- lucide-react for icons
- Socket.io for real-time communication
- PeerJS for WebRTC video calls
- sonner for toast notifications

## UI Migration Status (January 2026)
- Migrated from Ant Design (antd) to shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS v4
- Applied modern Lark/Loop-inspired design
- All @ant-design/icons replaced with lucide-react in user-facing components
- Admin section still uses antd (lower priority)
- All user-facing components now use shadcn/ui

## Recently Migrated Components
- FileItem, ReplyBlock, InfoTitle, PinItem, ConversationAvatar
- ListReaction, ModalCreateGroup, ModalAddMemberToConver
- CallVideo ActionNavbar (now uses shadcn Button instead of antd Menu)
- ShortMessage (FcBarChart → BarChart3 from Lucide)
- GroupCard (BsThreeDotsVertical → MoreVertical from Lucide, improved card styling)
- UserMessage toast notifications fixed to use sonner pattern

## Design System (January 2026)
- **Message bubbles**: 
  - Sent: gradient primary background (from-primary to-primary/90), rounded-[18px], max-width 75%
  - Received: slate-100 background, rounded-[18px], max-width 75%
- **Conversation list**: rounded-2xl cards, ring-based active states, improved unread badges
- **Timestamps**: 11px font size, 70% opacity for sent messages
- **Seen indicator**: CheckCheck icon in emerald-500
- **Modal dialogs**: rounded-2xl containers, rounded-xl inputs/buttons
- **Hover states**: slate-50 background for list items, subtle shadows

## Development
- Run: `npm run dev` (starts Vite dev server on port 5000)
- Build: `npm run build` (outputs to `dist/`)

## Notes
- This is a frontend-only application that connects to an external backend API
- Backend API URL should be configured via `VITE_API_URL` environment variable
- All UI text is in Vietnamese - maintain language consistency

## User Preferences
- Use shadcn "new-york" style preset
- Prefer lucide-react icons over @ant-design/icons
- Use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag when installing packages due to peer dependency conflicts
- Maintain Vietnamese language throughout the UI
